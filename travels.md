Call me Jerry Reynolds because I LOVE Sacramento, California. (That's the sorta reference you'd likely only understand if you're from Sacramento, California.)

I lived there in my late teens/early twenties, and the city truly is responsible for much of what I value about myself: my work ethic, my ability to scrape by on my own, etc.

Now, whenever I have a chance, I love to visit Midtown Sacramento (the local "cool" neighborhood), and walk around all my old haunts, going to as many Kings games as possible.

In the future I'd like to use my tech money to buy a nice lil bike rack to go on the back of our car, bring my wife up to midtown with both of our bikes, and spend our days biking around that flat wonderland.

If you live within a day's drive of Sacramento and you haven't visited. I highly recommend a day or two in midtown. It's adorable, the food's v tight, it's wildly walkable, and it's covered in trees because it's basically a government town and say what you will about the government but they're better than corporations at growing trees and not chopping them down.

Here's an airbnb link to make your search easier:

Again, midtown is the neighborhood that you're gonna wanna stay in
