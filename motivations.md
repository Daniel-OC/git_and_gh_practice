My motivations are largely related to turning 30.

It has become very clear to me that my old value system no longer aligns with my current self.

I used to be willing to be broke forever if it meant that I got to pursue making art for money.

I now feel two things that run counter to that value system:
- I want to be able to support anyone in my life who falls upon hard times, whether that be parents aging, siblings experiencing bad beats, etc. That means making more money.
- I don't want to make art for money more than I just want to be able to make art. In fact I now find the idea of making art other than exactly the art I want to make kind of offensive, and would hate to push my nose against the grindstone for years just to write some crappy sitcom that I hate.

I was originally going to school to become some sort of engineer, but I did a little bit of programming at work and it hooked me. It's fun as hell to build tools, and I wish someone would have described programming that way to me sooner! It's highly creatively fulfilling if you're building the right stuff!
